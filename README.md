# Osborne Mine, Australia - Airborne total-field magnetic anomaly

This is a section of a survey acquired in 1990 by the Queensland Government,
Australia. The data are good quality with approximately 80 m terrain clearance
and 200 m line spacing. The anomalies are very visible and present interesting
processing and modelling challenges, as well as plenty of literature about
their geology.

## Changes made

> These are the changes made to the original dataset.

* Change the horizontal datum from GDA94 to WGS84.
* Convert terrain clearance to flight height using an SRTM grid.
* Keep only the coordinates, AWAGS leveled magnetic anomaly, and flight line
  ID.
* Cut to a smaller region containing only the 2 anomalies of interest.

## About this repository

This is a place to format and prepare the original dataset for use in our
tutorials and documentation.

We include the source code that prepares the datasets for redistribution by
filtering, standardizing, converting coordinates, compressing, etc.
The goal is to make loading the data as easy as possible (e.g., a single call
to `pandas.read_csv` or `xarray.load_dataset`).
Whenever possible, the code also downloads the original data (otherwise the
original data are included in this repository).

> ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** The easiest way to download this dataset is using
> [Pooch](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch), particularly to download straight
> from the DOI of a release.
